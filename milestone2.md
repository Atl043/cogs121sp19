# Milestone 2
## Idea
We have the same idea as we proposed in Milestone1, which is helping color blind people identify and match colors for their outfits. However, the color detection API we used is different from what we originally proposed.

## Screenshot similarity to Paper Prototype
Our UI skeleton followed the flow of paper prototype 1. Some styling is bit different such as the placement of certain buttons. We plan to add additional styling in the future to make our pages look more visually asethetic.
