# Milestone 2
## Idea
We have the same idea as we proposed in Milestone1, which is helping color blind people identify and match colors for their outfits.
## UI Skeleton
Our UI skeleton followed the flow of paper prototype 1. Some style is bit different, and the color detection API we used is different. 
<br/>
However, in the future we will add additional styling that might differ from our paper prototype1.
